However, existing techniques are based on Euclidean geometry which is not an optimal choice for modeling complex cell trajectories with multiple branches. To overcome this fundamental representation issue we propose Poincaré maps, a method harnessing the power of hyperbolic geometry into the realm of single-cell data analysis. | facebookresearch    | 89    |
